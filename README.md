# Snake
That is a snake game that I'm really proud of for some reason that I'll explain below !
I code it in python with pygame.

## How to run
Run the file '*main.py*' and you should be able to play the game.
Do not forget to have *pygame* module install.
You can install with the command `pip install pygame`.
Check this documentation for more : https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

## Versions
- version 1.0 : (10/11/2020)
  - Game is working pretty well. No sounds, no assets, no fonts, just the basic game 

## More about
I started this 'project' at 8 AM, the 10th September 2020, when I was in my highschool, and I finished the first version at about 6 PM on the same day. I code it almost entierly when I had some free time in my highschool (so not much, just few hours), the code and also the game are pretty fine I guess. I didn't think that I would be able to do this that quickly !
